            Lawyers spend hours lost in inboxes, juggling deadlines and client
            communications with tools never built for legal work. We&apos;re
            engineers who saw that gap and built Case0: an inbox that organizes
            itself by case, flags critical filings, and brings clarity without
            adding complexity. We&apos;re starting with a private beta â€” join
            the waitlist to help shape the future of legal email.
